# RotateKey

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Payload** | **string** | The key material that you want to import into the service for rotating an existing root key. This value is  required for a &#x60;rotate&#x60; action if you initially imported the key material when you created the key.     To rotate an imported root key, provide a base64 encoded payload in the request entity-body. To rotate a root key that was initially generated by Key Protect, omit the &#x60;payload&#x60; property and pass in an empty request entity-body. | [optional]
